This is a Streamlit app that displays the resolution differences between images captured by the Hubble telescope and the James Webb telescope.
The code is very small and is inspired by the Webb Compare website.

To run the app, open the terminal inside the repository folder and type' streamlit run app.py', then wait for the website to load.
